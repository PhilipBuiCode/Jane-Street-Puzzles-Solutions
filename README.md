# Jane Street Puzzle Solutions

This repositry contains my personal solutions to the monthly Jane Street Puzzle. These puzzles mostly involve some kind of logic / math / visualization 
aspect and sometimes come with a twist. I have been participating since Dec 2022. Some of my solutions don't include coding, some include some helper functions, 
and some are strictly code. I sometimes go back and look at older puzzles (mostly the ones where the solution is not explicitly described on the website). 

If you would like to collaborate, connect with me on LinkedIn.

Puzzle of the month can be found here :  https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/current-puzzle/

Archives for past puzzles can be found here : https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/archive/

I only post my solution after the month's end. Not all solutions can be found here as I do not attempt / succeed every puzzle. 

A great repository of all past problems is currently being updated here : https://github.com/gowen100/Jane-Street-Solutions.
