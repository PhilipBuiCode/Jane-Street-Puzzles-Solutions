# February 2014 Puzzle Solution

I solved this one like a normal Sudoku. 

I made the below board to facilitate the process.

The "SUM" column / row returns the current sum of the column / row.  
The "GOOD ?" column / row returns true if the column / row is legal (equal to the required number).  
The "LEFT" column / row returns the difference between the current sum and required number.

It was then a matter of filling in the spots in an order that made logical sense (*i.e.* fill in the spots that are guaranteed to have this 
number or guaranteed to be empty). For example, I started with the the largest row (42) and filled in everything except the 2's and 4's. Afterwards, 
I could fill the entire (5) column with zeros since that column was finished. Afterwards, it was a matter of processing simililarly and making connections 
for the rest of the board.

Some tips : think about divisibility, multiples, and potential combinations.
